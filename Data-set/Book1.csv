Dishonoured by History,"English, Hindi", Radhakrishna Meena,"History, Crime, Politics","In this path-breaking study, Meena Radhakrishna traces the History and implications of a piece of colonial legislation--the Criminal Tribes Act. She discusses the changing notions of Crime and criminality over a period of time, and shows how the colonial administration's traditional prejudice against gypsies combined with realpolitik on the one hand, and with a need for wage workers on the other, to feed into the category 'hereditary criminal'. Focusing on the itinerant trading community of Koravas in colonial Madras, Dr Radhakrishna studies in detail the process of its forced sedentarisation in a police and missionary-run settlement. Here the community was meant to be reformed, albeit more through wage work than evangelism. The study shows how inspite of severe and repeated ruptures from its past, the community survived and forged a strong trade union movement. The archival sources used in this study establish the community to have been an honourable and useful part of sedentary society in the past. However, through a careful analysis of its present oral Culture and folklore, Dr Radhakrishna shows that its members have lost memory of that History, and share the widespread belief of the community's earlier, dangerous criminality."

God's Human Future: The Struggle to Define Theology Today,"English, Hindi",David Galston,"History, Personal Development","Biblical studies and theology for some time now have operated as independent fields of study, but recent developments have opened up new avenues for them to engage one another. Both fields must now address the question: what is the value of religion for the future? Here Galston draws upon two types of theology for his response. The first, Covenant theology, arises from the Hebrew Bible, iwht its image of God in agreement or covenant with a nation. The second, Enlightenment theology, arises from the wisdom tradition where the divine finds reality in the lifestyle of individuals and communities. After the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, Christianity came to be defined not by the parables of Jesus, which are open to many different interpretations, but rather by the belief that History will end in apocalypse. With the rise of the sciences, Western Culture has kept this apocalyptic outlook but replaced religion with human reason. Galston rejects the belief that religion can be reduced to scientific ideas. Instead, he argues that religion, like Poetry, holds value because it expands one's vision of life. Understood in this light, religion, though a human creation, is certainly not a waste of time."
